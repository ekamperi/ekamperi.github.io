Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). By now Covid-19 is a pandemic. In many countries where lockdown was not decided in time, the cases showed exponential growth. After talking with many people, I came to understand that lots of folks have some misconceptions about how the exponential function behaves. Here are my thoughts regarding this matter.

1. Lack of fast growth, rules out exponential dynamics.

For "small" values of $$x$$, an exponential function can be approximated by a linear function. This means that it can masquerade as a linear function.

Recall that $$exp(x)$$ can be expressed as a McLaurin series:

$$
exp(x) = 1 + x + (1/2)*x^2 + (1/6)*x^3 + \ldots
$$
