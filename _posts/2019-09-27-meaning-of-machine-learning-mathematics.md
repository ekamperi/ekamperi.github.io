This post was triggered by a paper posted here, titled "Deep learning fro symbolic mathematics". The authors trained a sequence-to-sequence neural network that was able to perform symbolic integration and solve differential equations. Remarkably, they achieved results that outperform commercial Computer Algebra Systems such as Matlab and Mathematica.
