### Dual spaces
Given a vector space $$V$$, we define its dual space $$V^*$$ to be the set of all *linear transformations* $$\varphi: V \to F$$, where $$\varphi$$ is a linear functional. Here is a list of examples:

* <ins>Example 1</ins>: Let $$V = \mathbb{R}^3$$ and $$\varphi: \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}$$, $$\varphi(x,y,z) = 2x+3y+4z$$

* <ins>Example 2</ins>: Let $$V = P_n$$ (the set of polynomials with degreee $$n$$ and $$\varphi: P_n \to \mathbb{R}$$, $$\varphi(p) = p(1)$$. E.g., $$\varphi(1 + 2*x + 3x^2) = 1 + 2*1 + 3*1^2 = 6$$.
