Given Given a vector space $$V$$, we define its dual space $$V^*$$ to be the set of all *linear transformations* $$\varphi: V \to F$$, where $\varphi$ is a linear functional. Here is a list of examples:

* Example 1: Let $$V = \mathbb{R}^3$$ and $$\varphi: \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}$$, $$\varphi(x,y,z) = 2x+3y+4z

* Example 2: Let $$V = $$
