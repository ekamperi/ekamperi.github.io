Quoting the wikipedia definition of the curl vector operator:

> In vector calculus, the curl is a vector operator that describes the infinitesimal rotation of a vector field in three-dimensional Euclidean space. At every point in the field, the curl of that point is represented by a vector. The attributes of this vector (length and direction) characterize the rotation at that point.

The devil in this definiton lies in the word *infinitestimal*. I was under the impression that curl was related to the *macroscopic* rotation, but I couldn't be more wrong! Let me show what I mean. Consider the vector field defined by $$f(x,y,z) = \left(-y/(x^2+y^2), x/(x^2+y^2), 0\right)$$.
