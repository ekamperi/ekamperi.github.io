My name is Stathis Kamperis, and I live in Greece. I am a [radiation oncologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_oncologist) and physicist with a master degree in [computational physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_physics) and another one in [medical research methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research). I currently work on my Ph.D. thesis, which involves applying machine learning in [radiomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiomics) in head neck cancer. You can [check my detailed bio in LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stathis-kamperis/).

[You can read my first master thesis](http://ikee.lib.auth.gr/record/289589/files/GRI-2017-19273.pdf?version=1), where I used [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/node/1) to run Monte Carlo simulations of external photon beams in human phantoms. Regrettably, the text is in Greek, but you might find the images and the code excerpts useful.

[You may also read my latest master thesis](https://ekamperi.github.io/mrm_thesis/abstract.html), where I analyzed the complexity of [Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_beam_radiotherapy#Volumetric_Modulated_Arc_Therapy) prostate plans. In the first part, I examined various complexity metrics with [Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) and [Mutual Information Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information). In the second part, I developed both a linear and a LASSO logistic regression model to predict complexity by clinical and dosimetric plan features.

[This is the list of my publications](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?hl=en&user=HMbAeKQAAAAJ) on medical journals.
