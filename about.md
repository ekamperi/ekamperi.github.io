I am a [radiation oncologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_oncologist) and physicist with a master degree in [computational physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_physics) and another one in [medical research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research) methodology. Currently, I work on my thesis which has to do with [radiomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiomics) in head neck cancer. You can [check my bio in LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stathis-kamperis/).

[Here you can read my 2nd master thesis](https://ekamperi.github.io/mrm_thesis/abstract.html), which had to do with complexity analysis in [Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_beam_radiotherapy#Volumetric_Modulated_Arc_Therapy) prostate plans.
