I am a radiation oncologist and physicist with a master degree in computational physics and another one in medical research methodology. Currently, I work
on my thesis which has to do with [radiomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiomics) in head neck cancer.

[Here you can read my 2nd master thesis](https://ekamperi.github.io/mrm_thesis/abstract.html), which had to do with complexity analysis in volumetric modulated arc therapy prostate plans.

[This is the list of my publications](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?hl=en&user=HMbAeKQAAAAJ).
